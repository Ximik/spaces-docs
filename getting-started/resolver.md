# Resolver

The Spaces protocol currently offers experimental support for resolving spaces to payment addresses.

### Try it out

You can experiment with this feature using the Spaces wallet CLI:

```
space-cli send 1000 --to @bob
```

This command sends 1000 satoshis to the owner of the Space `@bob`.

### Upcoming changes

We're in the process of formalizing the format for space records. You will be able to resolve spaces to [silent payment addresses](https://silentpayments.xyz/), [Nostr](https://nostr.com), [onion services](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/) and more so stay tuned!&#x20;
